need to make the frame size larger than the windows size. 
rotate images to check biases and make more training data.

Next steps - 
Build a classifier such as random forest for our data.
Need breast tissue corpus that has been labeled.
    Not every event is labeled.

Read annotation information from the breast tissue corpus

Labeled data
/data/isip/data/tuh_dpath_breast/deidentified/v3.0.0

for every svs we want to load a csv file talk to phuykong about that file we don't know the name currently.

Check to see if the frame is within the label. Play with the threshold like if 70% of frame has INDC data then its cancerous.

If the center of the frame is inside that region consider the frame to be that label.

Topology or geometry to check if a point is within bounds python.
