window frame must be larger that image because it will be a higher resolution and more data

windows control how much data to take in. window must be 256 by 256.
frames control how many iterations to go over the whoel image

random forest
need labeled data
breast tissue corpus have been labeled.
not every event is labeled. 

to-do
read annotation information

corresponding csv files for all svs files.
coordinates of the regions that have been labeled in csv file

for every svs file, load csv file. already a software that does this (?)
determine the frame within one of the regions.

coordinates are in pixels.

find which of the windows/frames all on the regions

determine threshold of how much the window falls within the region.

labeled only 10% or less of each image

take the center of the frame and ask if its inside the region
