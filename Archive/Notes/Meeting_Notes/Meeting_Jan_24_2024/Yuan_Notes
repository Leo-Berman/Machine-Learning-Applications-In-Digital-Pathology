pet scan - high resolution images of tissue of organs
17 different type of organs

data given will be manually labeled by another team

develop an algorithm to identify the regions of these cells/pathogens to detect cancer

find where on the slide

automatic interpretation - identifying areas on the slide that are potentially cancerous,
there are 9 different types

- first stage - take image - segmentated image
- second stage - makes decision

part of the goal - convert image to smth


start simple program that reads images and blah blah


training process
decoding / classification - classifies each image
scoring - score the results



final - read a slide, process, display annotations 

download image scope

write a prgram that iterates over image and calculates the energy from the image
