Chapter 1 Quiz Answers:
1.) Two major branches of statistics = descriptive and inferential
2.) Data types = Ordinal, Ratio, Nominal, Interval
    Non Data Types = Computational
3.) Example of statistical methods used in data cleaning = outlier detection and imputation

Chapter 2 Quiz Answers:
1.) Median is the middle value of all the values when sorted
2.) Types of means = Arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean
3.) The general rule is that if value X is at the kth percentile, then X is greater than K% of the values.
4.) Measures of central tendency = Mean, median, and mode
    Non measures of central tendency = variance
5.) Variance is equal to the average of the differences of all numbers to the mean in a data set
6.) Range represents the difference between the max and min values in a dataset
7.) Standard error is the standard deviation of the set of means (the measure of the variability within a sample used to estimate a population parameter)
8.) Standard deviation is the square root of the variance
