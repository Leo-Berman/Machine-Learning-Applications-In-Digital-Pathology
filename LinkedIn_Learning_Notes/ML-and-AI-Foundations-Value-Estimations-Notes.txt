CHAPTER 1

    What is Machine Learning?
        - computer algorithms that have the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed

    Filtering Program
        ex. email -> filtering program -> real emails
                                    -> spam emails

    Machine Learning Algorithm
        Emails
        -> predicted real email
        -> predicted spam email
        based on the training data, it can predict what email is real or spam. 

    Supervised Learning
        - computer looks at labeled data to learn
        - the data and outcome is already given for the computer to realize the relationship between the data and outcome
        - if it sees enough examples, it can predict the outcome of the next data

    Gradient Descent
        - an iterative optimization algorithm that can be used to minimize cost function and find the best weights
        - tweak components more and more until it gets as close as possible to the outcome that is wanted

CHAPTER 2

    Numpy
        - array and linear algebra functions
        - foundation for other ML libraries

    scikit-learn
        - machine learning library

    pandas
        - easy to load data w large data sets similar to spreadsheet

    numpy => pandas +. scikit-learn

    Gradient Boosting
    - a ML algorithm that uses an ensemble of decision trees to predict values
