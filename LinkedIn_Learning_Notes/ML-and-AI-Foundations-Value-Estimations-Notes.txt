CHAPTER 1

    What is Machine Learning?
        - computer algorithms that have the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed

    Filtering Program
        ex. email -> filtering program -> real emails
                                       -> spam emails

    Machine Learning Algorithm
        Emails
        -> predicted real email
        -> predicted spam email
        based on the training data, it can predict what email is real or spam. 

    Supervised Learning
        - computer looks at labeled data to learn
        - the data and outcome is already given for the computer to realize the relationship between the data and outcome
        - if it sees enough examples, it can predict the outcome of the next data

    Gradient Descent
        - an iterative optimization algorithm that can be used to minimize cost function and find the best weights
        - tweak components more and more until it gets as close as possible to the outcome that is wanted

CHAPTER 2

    Numpy
        - array and linear algebra functions
        - foundation for other ML libraries

    scikit-learn
        - machine learning library

    pandas
        - easy to load data w large data sets similar to spreadsheet

    numpy => pandas => scikit-learn

    Gradient Boosting
    - a ML algorithm that uses an ensemble of decision trees to predict values

    Decision Tree
    - option 1: complex decision tree
        - tree with many branches of decisions and outcomes
        - large tree does not work well with new data
        - not v accurate w a lot of data in one big tree
    - option 2: ensemble learning
        - many small trees and combining the outcome of all the trees to make one final outcome

CHAPTER 3

    1. By convention, the features you feed into a machine learning algorithm are typically identified by which letter?
        > X
    2. By convention, what do you call the data attributes you feed into a machine learning algorithm?
        > features
    3.  > more training data is usually better than less training data
        > a good starting point is to have 10 times as many data points in the training data set as the number of features in the model
        > machine learning algorithms work best when your training data set covers a wide range of combinations of features in your model

CHAPTER 4

    1. What is one-hot encoding?
        > a way to convert categorical data into a format suitable for use in a machine learning model
    2. To get the best results from machine learning, what should you do?
        > use features in your model that correlate strongly with the output values you want to predict
    3. Because of the curse of dimensionality, you should _____.
        > include as few features as possible in your model while still accurately modeling the problem

CHAPTER 5

    1. What is a training data set used for?
        > it's used to do the initial training of your model
    2. What is true about a test data set?
        > it is used to verify that your model works accurately on data it has never seen before
    3. Mean absolute error is _____.
        > a measurement of the average prediction error across your data set

CHAPTER 6

    1. Underfitting is when: the model is too simple to fit the data
    2. What is true about overfitting?
        > it occurs when the model is too complex to fit the data
        > it can be addressed by reducing the complexity of the model or using regularization
        > it results in poor prediction accuracy
    3. a way to find the best hyperparameters for a machine learning model by trying many different possible combinations
    4. What is true about feature selection?
        > help us understand which features are most important to your model
        > find features that are not needed and can be removed from your model
        > give us a better idea of which features your model is using most often to predict values

CHAPTER 7

    1. When using a machine learning model in a real application:
        > you should test the accuracy of new models before using them to replace an existing model
        > When using a machine learning model in a real application:
        > you need to provide the input features in exactly the same format they were provided in during training
