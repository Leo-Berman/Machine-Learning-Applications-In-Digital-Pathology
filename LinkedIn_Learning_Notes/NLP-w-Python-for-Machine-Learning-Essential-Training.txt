1. NLP Basics

    NLP = Natural Language Processing
    field concerned w the ability of a computer to understand, analyze, manipulate, and potentially generate human language.

    examples
    - spam filtering
    - auto-correct
    - auto-complete

    Natural Language Toolkit

    findall() - finds the words/characters and returns those
    split() - splits the string by specific characters and returns the splitted strings

    REGEX
        - \W and \w (word)
        - \S and \s (space)
        capital refers to non-[character] such as \W refers to non-word

    Raw test - model can't distinguish words
    Tokenize - tell the model what to look at
    Clean text - remove stop words/ punctuation, stemming, etc.
    Vectorize - convert to numeric format
    Machine Learning Algorithm - fit/train model
    Spam Filter - system to filter emails

    Quiz:

    1) Which choice is an example of unstructured data?
        > a PDF document
          - A PDF document usually contains free flowing text with no defined patterns for punctuation and formatting.
    2) When using pd.read_csv(), how can you tell it that you are using tabs as separators and there are no headers?
        > sep="\t", header=None
    3) What is the length of the list returned by the following split call: re.split('\s',"This is an interesting te+st")
        > 5
    4) What is the core component of natural language processing?
        > extracting information from human language
    5) What built-in Python function can be used to help remove special characters from a text file?
        > string.punctuation
    6) When would you use the + sign in a regular expression?
        > when you need to return more than one character at a time
    7) How would you describe the concept of stemming?
        > Though they may have different affixes, words that share the same stem have similar semantic meaning. Stemming is able to determine that 'learned' and 'learning' , though they have different affixes, each contain the same root word 'learn'.
    8) Besides manual parsing, what is an alternative method to parse a tab-delimited text file?
        > Use the Pandas read csv function.
    9) In the machine learning pipeline, _____ is about converting to numeric form.
        > vectorizing
    10) Before you begin to create a replacement expression, what should be true about your findall expression?
        > It is able to capture the correct sequence and any misspellings.
    11) What should be your first step when trying to read an unstructured text file into your code?
        > Read the text file to see patterns and determine the next step.
    12) What is the result of the following call: re.findall('[A-Z]+', "I like this test")
        > ['I']
    13) What is an important consideration when testing regular expressions?
        > Make sure extra spaces and special characters are correctly handled.
