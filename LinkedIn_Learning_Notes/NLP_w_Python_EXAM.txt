1) Select the regular expression that returns the full year 2018, and not the single numbers individually.
    - [0-9]+
2) Select the scenario that would not make a feature a prime candidate for transformation.
    - short tail
3) You believe that spam text messages are longer than real ones. What is one way to determine if you are correct?
    - Create a feature that contains bins for the length of each text message and plot the data on a histogram.
4) After reading the data using pd.read_csv() into x, how can you tell the number of rows?
    - len(x)
5) Which step is important when creating a new feature?
    - analyzing the dataset and coming up with a hypothesis
6) Why would you need to apply a transformation to your data?
    - to lessen the effect of outliers to make better correlations
7) Which statement about training a gradient boosting model is TRUE?
    - An n_jobs parameter is not needed.
8) How does gradient boosting work?
    - It combines weak learners together to form a strong learner by improving on mistakes from prior test iterations.
9) Which two concepts are combined to create a more powerful tool to tune and evaluate machine learning models?
    - grid search and cross validation
10) How would you define a stop word?
    - a frequently used word that doesn't contribute to the meaning of the sentence
11) What is the purpose of a grid search?
    - to apply different combinations of hyperparameter settings to see if test set performance can be improved
12) The function that takes a sentence and splits it in a string of words is _____.
    - tokenize
13) What is true about TF-IDF? (has to do with vectorizing)
    - The columns still represent single unique terms.
    - The cells represent a weighting,
    - There is still one row per text message.
14) NLP is a field concerned with the ability of a computer to _____ human language.
    - manipulate
    - understand
    - analyze
15) What does an n-gram represent?
    - all combinations of n adjacent words
16) In bigram, how many tokens will be generated for the statement "NLP is an interesting topic"?
    - 4
17) Why is lemmatizing more accurate in finding word variations that have the same meaning?
    - It has a database of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs that are grouped together as sets of synonyms.
18) Lemmatizing 'meanness' and 'meaning' results in _____.
    - meanness meaning
19) Random forest is an example of what type of method?
    - ensemble
20) Why do you need a holdout test set?
    - to evaluate a model's ability to generalize to unseen data
21) Which of these is NOT an example of supervised learning?
    - grouping together similar emails into distinct folders based on the content
22) How does the Box-Cox power transformation work?
    - It applies a range of exponents to your data points to determine if the result fits closely to a normal distribution.
23) If X is -2, which one of the following is a correct transformation?
    - 1/y^2
24) Which statement best describes a bimodal distribution graph?
    - a curve with two large spikes in different locations
25) Lemmatizing _____.
    - is slower than stemming
26) Why is it necessary to analyze the output of a stemming process?
    - Stemming algorithms are not perfect, as they can stumble on slang words and certain root words.
27) What is the result of running the stemmer against 'run', 'running', and 'runner'?
    - run run runner
28) Why is stemming important?
    - It reduces variations of the same root word to produce a smaller number of tokens.
29) Stemming Meanness/meaning will result in _____.
    - Mean
30) Using the NLTK, which package can be called to get a pre-defined list of stop words?
    - nltk.corpus.stopwords.words
31) What will be displayed on the screen when the following code runs?

    tokenized = ['test','in','the','rest','of','for','new','last']
    result = [word for word in tokenized if word not in
    ['in','on','the','of','for']]
    print(result)

    - ['test', 'rest', 'new', 'last']
32) When writing your own tokenization function, which essential step must your function be able to do?
    - Use a regex function to remove all non-word characters from the data file.
33) What will be printed with the following statement:

    print(re.split('\W+',"some of the-words are+combined"))

    - ['some', 'of', 'the', 'words', 'are', 'combined']
34) What stop word that will be removed from this sentence: "This is a test for the man to be successful in their lives"?
    - the
    - to
    - for
35) In the spam-ham example, what does a recall rate of 55.2% mean?
    - 55.2% of spam properly went to the spam folder while the rest went to the inbox.
36) What does it mean when a random forest has max_depth=none and n_estimators=10?
    - the random forest will have 10 decision trees of unlimited depth
