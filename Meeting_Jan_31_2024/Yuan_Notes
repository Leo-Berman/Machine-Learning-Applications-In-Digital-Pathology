already have software that processes images at full resolution

image is about 3000 MB

breast tissue subset with 3500 images already annotated

7-8 different types of tissues
breast tissue already know how to annotate

download image scope (on windows)

identify 5-10 regions of image and one of it may have one fo the 9 cancers

annotated images has coordinates that point to the regions of the image that may have cancer

goal is to build an algorithm that corresponds to the regions that are annotated in the images
however some images are not annotated

start w/ fox chase material
-> 

write a proram (decoder) that takes a modeul and takes parameters that sets various thresholds, process the files and runs a score


first, write a simple program that iterates over image

principle component analysis


two programs to create
->  trainer -> iterates over all of the image
->  decoder -> reads the model

histogram of the rms value of the pixels in a wondow (for whole database)

program -> give a list of image files, set the frame duration in pixels, and it iterates over images and compute sqr value fo the pixels or smething lese.

analayze the data and chapters to be able to explain the 9 categories of cancer



1. stats program to generate histogram of temple data of breast tissue
2. familarize with 9 different labels of regions of the cancer
