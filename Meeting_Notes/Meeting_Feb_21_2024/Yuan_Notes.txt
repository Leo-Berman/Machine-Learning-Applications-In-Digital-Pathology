one option is to convert window to one long vector

there is already a library that does the label parsing

research shapely library

for each window,
have a label
label may be an actual label or unlabeled
unlabeled does not get processed to the trainer

take image in pixels and convert it to one long vector.

index is the shape number

coord_index, row, and col are all a set for the vertices of the region

dct approach - 2 min fourier transform of image and converting to freq domain

pixel approach - concatenate to one long vector

big image -> window -> neural netowrk / trainer -> model
                    -> decoder -> decision (frame by frame) -> classifier -> decision (overall decision)
                    (model and window goes into decoder)    |
                                                            |
                                                            |
                                                            |
                                                            feature engineering

want the code to be modular

1) write a preprocessor that takes a list of images
    every image file has a list of annotation
    frame size and window size
    outputs a csv file (has a label and vector (vector could be rgba values or vertices or dct))
    convert 2D image to vector

    csv, only want windows that have labels and a vector of the RGB values

if window is 20x20,
vector size is 20x20(=400) *3(bc RGB values)
