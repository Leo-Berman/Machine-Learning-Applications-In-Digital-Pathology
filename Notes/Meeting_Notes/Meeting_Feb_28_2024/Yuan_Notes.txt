signal -> FFT -> take only magnitude

minimum phase representation
- magnitude of spectrum is the same
- phase is zero

DCT on images
- taking signal that is very dispersed in time and 'compressing it' by making it more compact in time
the coefficients represent the magnitude of the frequencies of the frames

establish baseline in performance

make the frames go through DCT before getting the RGBA values

separate the coordinates that fall in each region
such as region1 has n amount of coordinates

give the trainer a list of files
reads over each frame of each file
convert each frame to vector
send vector to random forest
label is outputted
