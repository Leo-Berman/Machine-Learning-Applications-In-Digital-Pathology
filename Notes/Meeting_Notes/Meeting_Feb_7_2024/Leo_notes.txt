SVS:
	Compressed Tiff files
	average = 50kx50k pixels
	R,G,B: 8-bits per color
	Not all of the slide is tissue, it can be one big piece of tissur or little pieces of tissue

XML(we have csv versions):
	label and coorseponding coordinates
End goal - Give model a slide and get a diagnosis and confidence %

Step 1 - A person gets a biopsy
Step 2 - A slice of their tissue gets put on a glass slide
Step 3 - Scan the slide into an image
Step 4 - Goes into our software system
Step 5 - Return a Segmentation, labels, and a score(severity/confidence/probability of cancer)
Step 6 - Prioritized for human review
Step 7 - Human makes the final report

Benefits: productivity enhancement, pathologist pool is shrinking,

!Heres the input heres the output find the mapping!

Step 1 - Labelled data
Step 2 - Split it into training, developer, and evaluation data
Step 3 - Build model from training data
     Step 3a - Learns mapping between input and labels
Step 4 - Evaluate on training data
Step 5 - Evaluate on developer set	      | Important note to not change attributes or features based on the evaluation data
Step 6 - Repeat steps 4 & 5 until model works |

Different slides have different overall colors and textures so our paramters must be relative becaeuse the fox chase slides are overall lighter in color than they are FOR temples slides.
